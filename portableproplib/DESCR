The proplib library provides an abstract interface for creating and
manipulating property lists.  Property lists have object types for
boolean values, opaque data, numbers, and strings.  Structure is provided
by the array and dictionary collection types.

Property lists can be passed across protection boundaries by translating
them to an external representation.  This external representation is an
XML document whose format is described by the following DTD:

This proplib version based on the same version than is available on NetBSD,
with the exception that it has been converted to be built through the
GNU autotools and has support for zlib.
